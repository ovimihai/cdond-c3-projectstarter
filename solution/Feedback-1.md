## Section 1: Selling CI/CD to your Team/Organization

The CI/CD benefits proposal contains essential benefits of CI/CD, and describes the business context that will benefit from the automation tools. Explanation should include benefits that translate to revenue and cost for the business.

Awesome work on the presentation ![:clap:](https://review.udacity.com/assets/images/emojis/clap.png)![:star:](https://review.udacity.com/assets/images/emojis/star.png)  
Although, It can be better if you add cost-related benefits(like diagrams) in the presentation![:raised_hands:](https://review.udacity.com/assets/images/emojis/raised_hands.png)
